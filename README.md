first repository - hello world

My name is Kelsey Weber. I'm 20-years-old and one of five kids on my family. I have two brothers and two sisters. I'm a Web Development major here at DCCC with hopes to graduate in May 2020. I like to spend time with my boyfriend Reed, my friends and family, take photos, play field hockey, and perform in musicals. I look forward to learning in this class and further my knowledge of computers.
